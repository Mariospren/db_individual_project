# Introduction to the Project:

In this project, we've been setting up a MongoDB database to store information about artists, albums, and songs for a music catalog. We've utilized the Jupyter Notebook environment for Python programming and the pymongo library to interact with MongoDB.

## Instructions:

1. **Opening the Jupyter Notebook:** To begin, open the `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. **Executing Cells:** To execute each cell in the notebook, press `Shift + Enter`. This will run the code in the cell and move to the next one.

## Steps Followed:

1. **MongoDB Database Setup:** We began by setting up a MongoDB database to store our music catalog data. This involved installing and configuring MongoDB on your local machine.

2. **Collection Creation:** After setting up the database, we created three collections: "artists", "albums", and "songs". These collections were used to organize and store information about artists, their albums, and the songs in those albums.

3. **Data Insertion:** Using the pymongo library, we inserted data into our collections. This included adding artists like "Taylor Swift" and "Beyonc√©", albums such as "1989" and "Lemonade", and songs like "Blank Space" and "Halo".

4. **Data Update:** We performed updates on the data in our database. For example, we updated the genre of an artist or the release year of an album to ensure our catalog stayed up-to-date.

5. **Data Query:** We queried our database to retrieve specific information, such as finding all albums released after a given year or identifying the song with the longest duration.

6. **Data Deletion:** As part of our database management, we deleted data from our collections. This included removing an artist and all their associated albums and songs from the catalog.

Throughout this process, we've used the Jupyter Notebook environment for Python programming, and the pymongo library to interact with MongoDB, allowing us to efficiently manage our music catalog data.
